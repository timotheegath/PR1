\section{Question 1}
\subsection{Eigenfaces}
\subsubsection{Part a)}
The faces dataset consisted of 10 pictures of each of the 52 different individuals. Hence, it was decided to split the data into 7 pictures per individual for training and 3 pictures per individual for testing. Moreover, the order of pictures per individual was randomised before to remove any possible correlation between the complexity/characteristics of the pictures and their order.
